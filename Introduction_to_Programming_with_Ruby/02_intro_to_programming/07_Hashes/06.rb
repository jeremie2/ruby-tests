# Given the following code...
# 
# x = "hi there"
# my_hash = {x: "some value"}
# my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}
# 
# What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?


# ANSWER

# x key in the first hash is a symbol.
# x key in the second hash is the variable defined at the beginning (x = "hi there").
