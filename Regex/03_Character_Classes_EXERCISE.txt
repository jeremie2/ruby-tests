########### EXERCISES 1

Write a regex that matches uppercase or lowercase K or a lowercase s. 
Test it with these strings:

Kitchen Kaboodle
Reds and blues
kitchen Servers

There should be six matches.

#####

/[Kks]/


########### EXERCISES 2

Write a regex that matches any of the strings cat, cot, cut, bat, bot, 
or but, regardless of case. Test it with this text:

My cats, Butterscotch and Pudding, like to
sleep on my cot with me, but they cut my sleep
short with acrobatics when breakfast time rolls
around. I need a robotic cat feeder.

There should be nine matches.

#####

/[cb][aou]t/i


########### EXERCISES 3

Base 20 digits include the decimal digits 0 through 9, and the letters A through J in upper or lowercase. Write a regex that matches base 20 digits. Test it with these strings:

0xDEADBEEF
1234.5678
Jamaica
plow ahead

There should be 28 matches.

#####

/[0-9a-j]/i

 or

/[0-9a-jA-J]/i


########### EXERCISES 4

Write a regex that matches any letter except x or X. Test it with these strings:

0x1234
Too many XXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxXXXXXXXXXXXX to count.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG

There should be 82 matches.

#####

/[a-wyz]/i

##### SOLUTION

/[A-WYZa-wyz]/


########### EXERCISES 5

Why is /[^xX]/ not a valid answer to the previous exercise?

#####

Because also other than alphabetical character are taken in consideration.


########### EXERCISES 6

Write a regex that matches any character that is not a letter. Test it with 
these strings:

0x1234abcd
1,000,000,000s and 1,000,000,000s.
THE quick BROWN fox JUMPS over THE lazy DOG!

There should be 45-46 matches.

#####

/[^a-z]/i


########### EXERCISES 7

Are /(ABC|abc)/ and /[Aa][Bb][Cc]/ equivalent regex? If not, how do they differ?

#####

/(ABC|abc)/
it matches only this 2 cases: ABC abc

/[Aa][Bb][Cc]/
it matches al cases ABC abc AbC aBc ABC... upper and lowercase


Can you provide an example of a string that would match one of these regex, but
not the other?

#####

/[a][b][c]/i will match /[Aa][Bb][Cc]/


########### EXERCISES 8

Are /abc/i and /[Aa][Bb][Cc]/ equivalent regex? If not, how do they differ? 

#####

Yes


Can you provide an example of a string that would match one of these regex, 
but not the other?

#####

No


########### EXERCISES 9

Challenge: write a regex that matches a string that looks like a simple negated 
character class range, e.g., '[^a-z]'. (Your answer should match precisely six 
characters.) Test it with these strings:

The regex /[^a-z]/i matches any character that is
not a letter. Similarly, /[^0-9]/ matches any
non-digit while /[^A-Z]/ matches any character
that is not an uppercase letter. Beware: /[^+-<]/
is at best obscure, and may even be wrong.

There should be three matches.

#####

\[^a-z0-9 \[\]\/.,\^:<]\i


########### SOLUTION

/\[\^[0-9A-Za-z]-[0-9A-Za-z]\]/

or

/[\[][\^][0-9A-Za-z]-[0-9A-Za-z][\]]/

Pattern   Explanation

\[ or [\[]   a literal [
\^ or [\^]   a literal ^
[0-9A-Za-z]  any of the usual character class range starting values
-            a literal '-'
[0-9A-Za-z]  any of the usual character class range ending values
\] or [\]]   a literal ]

The three matches are /[^a-z]/i, /[^0-9]/, and /[^A-Z]/. Technically, the last 
regex string in our sample text, /[^+-<]/, is a valid regex; there is nothing 
illegal about character class ranges that don't use alphanumeric starting and 
ending points. However, you should avoid such ranges; think of them as invalid.
