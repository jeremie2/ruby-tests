Goal of the lesson:

1- fluency in the syntax
2- start to think like programmer building many little programs and debugging them
  â†’ building logical mindset

Topics:
- PROCEDURAL PROGRAMMING: still not clear what it is but basically it has something to do with building a program with logical step by step using basic functionalities we already know.
- OBJECT PROGRAMMING: something more sophisticated that will add more benefits in programming.

Learning to code vs learning to program:
- CODING: focus on the syntax, building basic construct 
- PROGRAMMING: building applications focusing on problem solving
We have to dial with the frustration of jumping from this to different layer!
PSEUDO CODE will help us: thinking first at the logic of a program and then at syntax

Looking for help:
- googling the right words (mind the error message!)
- get help on lesson forums/chatrooms (tell what you have done, what is the error... whatever can help)

What we learn is: APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT
