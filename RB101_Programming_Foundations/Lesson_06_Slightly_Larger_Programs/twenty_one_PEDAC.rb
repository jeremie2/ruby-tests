# 1. Card deck (52 cards): 2-10, J. Q, K, A (hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades)
#    - Values: J = Q = K = 10, A = 
# 2. Two players: Player and Dealer
#    - Both receive 2 cards each
#    - Player can watch his cards and just one of Dealer
# 3. Target: reach total <= 21
# 4. Player's turn:
#    - Stay: his cards are OK
#    - Hit: ask for another card to be added to the existing till he thinks cards 
#           are fine
#    - Check each time if 'busted' (total > 21 # => player looses)
# 5. Dealer turn:
#    - increase total till 17 is reached or overtaken
#    - Check if Dealer 'busted' (total > 21 # => Dealer looses)

#    - If Dealer busted: Player wins
#    - If total_player > total_dealer: Player wins
