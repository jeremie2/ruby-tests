############# Variables and passing by value and passing by reference


Hello world!
I'm starting this blog as requested/suggested by Launch School, the course I'm following on Ruby language and web development.
As first article I think there's nothing better than talking about variables. Isn't it? :)

One thing I liked about this course is the attention given from the beginning to how variables work and what happens behind the scenes when we write ordinary code like this: 

a = 'Good morning!'
b = a
funct(a)

For many it looks obvious, but for beginners not having a good understanding of how data is stored and used by variables and functions can lead to unexpected results. And actually... that's what happened to me!
We can experience different types of errors while starting to learn programming, but the one I remember the most was that for a while I had the idea that functions were like mathematical formulas.
Just think about rectangle's area:

Area = Length * Height 

If you want to find the area given two sides:

side_1 = 20
side_2 = 10

all you have to do is using the formula has a template where you just replace variable:

Area = Length * Height = side_1 * side_2 = 20 * 10

If we take the same approach to create a method (functions in Ruby) that randomly changes a variable called name, we see that the result may be unexpected:

def change_name(name, names)
  name = names.sample
end

people = ['Rob', 'Sam', 'Jim']
person = 'Alan'

A beginner (as it was in my case) may think to just substitute the variables, and:

name = names.sample
 
becomes:
 
person = people.sample
 
Then he may think that after invoking that methods the value of person will change... but it doesn't.
Running the code inside pry https://pry.github.io/ we can easily see that the function does return a new name:

change_name(name, names)
=> "Jim"

but the original variable is unchanged:

name
=> "Alan"

let's see in more in-depth..


##################### LET'S CREATE SOME VARIABLES

As already said I really liked how in Lesson 2 of the RB101 Programming Foundation course this topic has been clearly explained. I have seen several beginner's guide for various program languages, but quite often this aspect tends to be taken for granted.

Let's see what happens when we assign for instance a string to a variable:

a = "apple"
a.object_id   # => 1140

We can look at variables as labels we create to refer to some physical memory address. object_id method shows an integer identifier associated to the object (our string).
Let's assign the a variable to a new variable:

b = a
b.object_id   # => 1140

And here we can notice something important. Both variables refer to the same object with ID 1140.
We'll see how that's crucial to understand how variables works when passed to a method.

To see some interesting stuff let's create more variables:

c = a
c.object_id   # => 1140

d = 'bread'
d.object_id   # => 1160

Here we can visualize the situation where an object, the string 'apple', has been assigned to variable a. This object got its own ID: 1140. Then the variable a is assigned to other two variables, b and c.
As we can see that all three variables refer to the same object:
                      _____________                         
                     |             |object_id
a = 'apple'     a →  |  "apple"    |1140
                     |_____________|

                      _____________
b = a           a →  |             |object_id
c = a           b →  |  "apple"    |1140
                c →  |_____________|


There's also a new variable d initialized with value 'bread'. No such a surprise that the object ID is different by ID of a, b and c. After all d refer to a different object.
                      _____________                         
                     |             |object_id
d = 'bread'     d →  |  "bread"    |1160
                     |_____________|


##################### LET'S DO SOME MODIFICATIONS

Let's modify b and c using two particular methods:
- string.upcase : returns a copy (new object) of the string with all uppercase characters. The original string doesn't change
- string.upcase! : turns to uppercase every character of the original string.

Here we are:

b = b.upcase
c.upcase!

To see what is happened we can print both variables and see with no surprise that both are now made of uppercase character:

p b   # => "APPLE"
p c   # => "APPLE"

What about variable a?

p a   # => "APPLE"

Let's check the object ID:

a.object_id   # => 1140
b.object_id   # => 1180
c.object_id   # => 1140

The ID of b is changed (1180) while a and c still share the same ID (1140). What is it happened?

- Variable b:
  performing b.upcase a new object has been created. This new object has been assigned to b therefore b is now pointing to a new object with different ID.
- Variable a and c:
  as already explained upcase! method doesn't create a new object. It directly changes the original object stored at a specific memory address to which a and c refer. 

That's the new situation:
      _____________                         
     |             |object_id
b →  |  "APPLE"    |1180
     |_____________|

      _____________
a →  |             |object_id
c →  |  "APPLE"    |1140
     |_____________|


##################### LET'S DO SOME MODIFICATIONS

We can now go back to the code met at the beginning of the article:  

def change_name(name, names)
  name = names.sample
end

people = ['Rob', 'Sam', 'Jim']
person = 'Alan'
change_name(person, people)

Our beginner student didn't get why performing:

change_name(person, people)

variable person didn't change. And now it should be clear why this happens.
When change_name method is invoked, first of all people and person variables are passed to the method. We have these variable assignments:

name = person
names = people

At this stage name and person refer to the same object, the string 'Alan'.
           _____________                         
person →  |             |object_id
name   →  |  "Alan"     |60
          |_____________|

Then an assignment is performed inside the method:

name = names.sample

At this stage a new object is assigned to name and whatever happens to name it will not affect person, because name refers now to a different object:
           _____________                         
person →  |             |object_id
          |  "Alan"     |60
          |_____________|
           _____________                         
name   →  |             |object_id
          |  "Jim"      |80
          |_____________| ('Jim' is just a possible example)



Let's see a different situation where inside a method we perform a method able to modify the object referred by the variable:

def modify_name(name)
  name.upcase!
end

person = 'Alan'
modify_name(person)
p person             # => "ALAN"

In this case variable person does change.
When method modify_name is invoked variable person is passed to it:

name = person

and name and person refer now to the same object:
           _____________                         
person →  |             |object_id
name   →  |  "Alan"     |60
          |_____________|

This time we don't assign a new object to name, but we call a method able to affect the object referred by variables name and person.
After performing name.upcase! the original string get modified and the two variable are still pointing the same object:
           _____________                         
person →  |             |object_id
name   →  |  "ALAN"     |60
          |_____________|


With that in mind it should be clear how things work ;)

Just an important thing to notice!
In the example seen here we have used strings. Strings (and also arrays and ashes) in Ruby are mutable objects and this means that it's possible to change a part of an object stored in a memory address.
Different situation with numeric variables. Numbers are not mutable, this means that two or more variables can point the same object (number), but there isn't any methods able to change the referred number as happens for instance with upcase! method with strings.

There is actually more to be said on this topic. The guide introduces the concepts of "pass by value" and "pass by reference", but this article wanted just to point out the basic concepts that can be tricky for noobs.

Thanks for reading.
