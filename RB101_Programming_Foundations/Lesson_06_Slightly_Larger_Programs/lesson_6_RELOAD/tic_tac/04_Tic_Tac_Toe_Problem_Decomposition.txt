########## TIC TAC TOE

First info:
- 2 player game
- 3X3 board
- each player marks a square
- first player to reach 3 squares in a row wins
- if all squares are marked and no player has 3 square in a row, it's a tie

Sequence:
1. Display the 3x3 board
2. Ask user to mark a square
3. Computer marks a square
4. Display the updated board
5. If winner, display winner
6. If board is full, display tie
7. If no winner or no tie, go back to #2
8. Play again?
9. If yes, go back to #1
10. Bye!

The sequence is at this stage high level.
It is "dominated" by two loops at #7 and #9.

This flowchart is still very generic and several sub-process need to be
sorted out expecially when inspetting the board.
