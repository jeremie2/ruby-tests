## SYNTACTIC SUGAR

# In the introduction to calculator program, it has been explained that
# Ruby is taking advantage of some syntactic sugar:

puts "ciao"

# in this case we are omitting parenthesis and the module's name.
# Here the long version:

Kernel.puts("ciao")


## INSPECT

# gets method is taking the input as a string

number1 = Kernel.gets()

# if we print it like this:

Kernel.puts("The number is:" + number1 + "!")

# the result will be:
#
# The number is: 5
# !
#
# Why? Let's use inspect module...

Kernel.puts(number1.inspect())

# "5\n"
# this shows that gets method is also assigning the new line '\n'.
