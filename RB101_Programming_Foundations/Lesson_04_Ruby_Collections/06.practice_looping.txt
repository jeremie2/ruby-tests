# In order to further solidify your understanding of loops, it's important to
# practice the knowledge you've acquired so far. Begin by completing the Loops 1
# set of exercises on the Exercises page. Once you've completed all the exercises
# in that set, complete Loops 2.

# Even if you've completed these exercises before reaching this assignment, it's
# worthwhile to take the time and briefly review the concepts covered in each
# exercise. At this point, you should feel comfortable with all of the looping
# elements and you shouldn't have any trouble writing loops that fulfill various
# requirements.

I have re-done these exercise trying to apply the PEDAC method.
All the files are into loop_pedac_1 and loop_pedac_2 folders.
