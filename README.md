# Readme

This repo contains lessons and exercises for the Ruby course at [launchschool.com](https://launchschool.com)

# File extentions

Most of the time I use `.txt` extention for files related to lessons.
I do this for two reasons:

0. writng markdown takes time;
0. `.txt` files will not be confused with 'script' files but they can be easily convert to Ruby script just changing `.txt` with `.rb`.
