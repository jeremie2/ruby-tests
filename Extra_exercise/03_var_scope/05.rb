# What will the following code print, and why?
# Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.

# a = "Xyzzy"
# 
# def my_value(b)
#   b = 'yzzyX'
# end
# 
# my_value(a)
# puts a

a = "Xy-zy"

# we give b the value of a. Both a and b points to "Xyzzy"
# then we assign 'yzzyX' to b.
# a doesn't change.
