# In the code below, sun is randomly assigned as 'visible' or 'hidden'.
# 
# sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample
# 
# Write an unless statement that prints "The clouds are blocking the sun!"
# unless sun equals 'visible'.

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

puts "The clouds are blocking the sun!" unless sun == 'visible'


# SOLUTION
# unless sun == 'visible'
#   puts 'The clouds are blocking the sun!'
# end
